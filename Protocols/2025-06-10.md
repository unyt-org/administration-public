## Resolution Audits
There is feedback for the following resolutions:

#research-on-datex-licensing : postponed till July

#auditor-25-tim 
#treasurer-25-benedikt 
#move-weinbergweg : Still no answer from the notary, expecting it this week, burocreacy..

# Internship Applications

We're primarily searching for Rust developers for the DATEX Core Rust, maybe Full-Stack developers for the DATEX workbench.

We decided to offer **5** out of **5** applicants a job interview.

# Technical Direction

We intend to focus on the development of DATEX Core Rust, with integration for common web development frameworks. UIX will have to step back in focus in favor of a stable rust implementation.

# News from Berlin

- 18.07. "New Web Technologies" fair
