## Resolution Audits
There is feedback for the following resolutions:

#move-weinbergweg: form is signed, will be handed in this month.

## PayPal Problems
- We opened the unyt.org shop with PayPal support
- Within a few weeks, the PayPal account has been banned permanently and forever for the entire organization
- Official representing persons of the association could not upload / get their ID documents accepted
- Support staff cannot see the reason for a permanent ban
- We don't see a significant violation of their ToS
- We can assume assume reasons – all of which are not fundamentally justified
- **Feedback** can be expected within one to two weeks. If we get no feedback in this timespan, we will never hear from them again.

# Trademarks
- Existing German UIX trademark of another company expired on Feb 28th
- We filed the appliction to reserve the UIX trademark for 10 years for 290€ with several categories (Dev Tools, CMS etc.)
	- We assume enough distinction from Oracle UIX
- UNYT.ORG is more difficult – we should consider trademarking it in the future

Request to trademark the product name DATEX:

| Resolution Label | Votes Pro | Votes Contra | Abstentions from Voting |

The request is **accepted.**

# End of Lecture – Public Relations
- We published a post on LinkedIn about Jonas' und Benedikt's visit for the final presentations of our Berlin lecture
- Gained quite a few impressions, amount of reactions and comments is underwhelming
