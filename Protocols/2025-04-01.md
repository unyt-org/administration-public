## Resolution Audits
There is feedback for the following resolutions:

#datex-trademark : We got feedback from the registration agency that our application has been received. We're awaiting more information.

#move-weinbergweg : Still working on it, will happen this month.

## UIX 0.4 Release: PR Performance
- LinkedIn performed well (roughly 100 views)
- We're going to mention the release in the April newsletter

# European Trademark Registration
There seems to be a "scholarschip" program for trademark registration where the registration costs of 8000€ are fully refunded. We will evaluate the feasibility of this option.
